## Java Primitives and Control Flow (Lab01)

This lab is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. These problems will challenge your understanding of Java’s built-in primitive values (ints, floats, doubles, Strings, booleans), for loops, while loops, if statements, functions, parameters and return statements.

## Feature Tasks

1. Pluralize
    * This feature requested that a method be created to pluralize a word if the number of that word was zero or greater than one.

2. Flipping Coins
    * This feature requested to write a functiuon called flipNheads that will accpet an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flippped in a row and the coin flips are simulated by choosing a random number between 0 and 1.Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

3. Command Line Clock
    * This feature requested to write a method for a clock that is using Java's LocalDateTime object to live print out the current system time to the console. The clock will also continue to run until ctrl-c or is stopped by the IDE.

## Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists (Lab02)

This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java

Created by: DaJon Ewing

## Feature Tasks

1. Rolling Dice
    * This feature requested to write a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

2. Contains Duplicates
    * This feature requested write a function that would return true or false depending on if the array had dupliates.
  
3. Calculating Averages
    * This feature requested to write a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4. Arrays of Array
    * This feature requested for an array of arrays to calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.

## Maps, File I/O, and Testing (Lab03)

This lab is dedicated to Map, File I/O and testing

Created by: DaJon Ewing

1. Maps (Analyzing Weather Data)
    * Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.

2. Tallying Election
    * Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

3. Linter    
    * Write a method that reads a JavaScript file with a given Path, and generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.
